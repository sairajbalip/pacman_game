## Project Title

**Pacman Game Implementation using Java**

## Project Description

This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Pacman game. The game features:

- A grid-based map with walls, food pellets, and ghosts.
- Pacman movement controlled by arrow keys.
- Ghosts that move randomly and chase Pacman.
- A scoring system that increases when Pacman eats food.
- A life system where Pacman loses lives when caught by ghosts.
- Game over and reset functionality.
- power-ups to allow Pacman to eat ghosts.

The game is built using Java Swing for the GUI, and it includes animations and basic game physics to create an engaging experience.

## Libraries Used

- **Java Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: Used for handling graphics and event listeners.
- **javax.swing.ImageIcon**: For loading and displaying images.
- **java.util.Random**: For randomizing ghost movement.

## File Structure

- **App.java**: The main entry point of the game. Initializes the game window and starts the game.
- **pacmangame.java**: Contains the core game logic, including movement, collision detection, rendering, and game loop.
- **Images (wall.png, pacman images, ghost images, etc.)**: Used for visual representation of game elements.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac App.java pacmangame.java
   ```
3. Run the game with:
   ```sh
   java App
   ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Java for game development and provides a fun and interactive Pacman game. It helps in understanding core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, event handling, and game loops.
